## Least Square Problem

$$min_{\beta}||y-x\beta||^2_2$$
where $y\in R^n$, $x\in R^{n\times p}$ and $\beta \in R^p$.


Pros and cons

* Closed-form solution $\beta = (x^Tx)^{-1}x^Ty$ when $n > p$;
* Easy to overfit;
* The solution is not well-defined when $n < p$.
    
Traditionally, *forward stepwise variable selection* is used to overcome some difficulties.

## Lasso vs. Ridge


Lasso problem (Tibshirani, 1996) (In signal processing, it is
called Basis Pursuit. (Chen and Donoho, 1995))

\begin{align}
&min_{\beta}||y-x\beta||^2_2\\
&st.||\beta||_1 \leq s
\end{align}

Ridge problem (Hoerl, 1962)

\begin{align}
&min_{\beta}||y-x\beta||^2_2\\
&st.||\beta||_2 \leq s
\end{align}


Lasso does variable selection while Ridge does not. However,
Ridge regression always has closed-form solution $\beta = (x^Tx+\lambda I)^{-1}x^Ty$

## Least Angle Regression (LAR) (Efron, 2004)

![Geometric interpretation of LAR](pic3.png)


## Least Angle Regression (LAR)

* Start with $r = y - mean(y)$, $\beta_1$, $\beta_2$, ... , $\beta_p = 0$. Assume $x_j$
standardized.

* Find predictor $x_j$ most correlated with $r$ (i.e.$j = arg max_{i \in \{1,...,p\}}|x^T_i r|)$.

* Increase $\beta_j$ in the direction of $sign(corr(r, x_j))$ until some other competitor $x_k$ has as much correlation with current residual as does $x_j$.

* Move $(\beta_j, \beta_k)$ in the joint least squares direction for $(x_j, x_k)$
until some other competitor $x_l$ has as much correlation with the current residual.

* Continue in this way until all predictors have been entered. Stop when $corr(r, x_j) = 0, \forall j$, i.e. OLS solution.


## Diabetes Data: Lasso and LAR


![Diabetes Data: Lasso and LAR. They are very similar.](pic4.png)


## Why are Lasso and LAR so similar?

Consider Lasso problem


\begin{align}
&min_{\beta}||y-x\beta||^2_2\\
&st.||\beta||_1 \leq s
\end{align}

Because the $l_1$ norm is the non-differentiable, we do the following: Let $\beta = \beta_+ - \beta_-$, Lasso problem becomes


\begin{align}
&min_{\beta_0,\beta_j^+,\beta_j^-}\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\beta_0-[\sum_{j=1}^p x_{ij}\beta_j^+ - \sum_{j=1}^p x_{ij}\beta_j^-])^2\\
&st.\beta_j^+ \geq 0, \beta_j^- \geq 0, \forall j; \sum_{j=1}^p \beta_j^+ +\beta_j^- \leq s
\end{align}



## KKT conditions for Lasso

The Lagrangian is


\(\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\beta_0-[\sum_{j=1}^p x_{ij}\beta_j^+ - \sum_{j=1}^p x_{ij}\beta_j^-])^2 +\lambda \sum_{j=1}^p (\beta_j^+ +\beta_j^-)- \sum_{j=1}^p \lambda_j^+ \beta_j^+ - \sum_{j=1}^p \lambda_j^- \beta_j^-\)

The KKT conditions are:

\begin{align}
-x_j^Tr + \lambda -\lambda_j^+ &=0\\
x_j^Tr + \lambda -\lambda_j^- &=0\\
\lambda_j^+ \beta_j^+ &=0\\
\lambda_j^- \beta_j^-&=0
\end{align}

where $r=y-\beta_01-[\sum_{j=1}^p x_j^+ \beta_j^+ - \sum_{j=1}^p x_j^- \beta_j^-]$


## KKT conditions for Lasso

* If $\lambda = 0$, then $x^T_j r = 0, \forall j$, and the solution corresponds to the unrestricted least-square fit.

\begin{align}
\beta_j^+ >0, \lambda >0 &\implies \lambda_j^+ =0\\
&\implies x_j^Tr = \lambda \\
&\implies \lambda_j^- >0\\
&\implies \beta_j^- =0
\end{align}

* Likewise $\beta_j^- >0, \lambda >0 \implies \beta_j^+ =0$. Hence 2 and 3 give
the intuitive result that only one of the pair ($\beta^+_j , \beta^-_j$) can be
positive at any time.

* $|x_j^Tr|\leq \lambda$.

* If $\beta^+_j>0$, then $x_j^Tr = \lambda$ or if $\beta^-_j>0$, then $-x_j^Tr = \lambda$

## The characteristic of the Lasso path


Definition

* Lasso path is given by $\beta(\lambda)$, where $\beta(\lambda)$ satisfies the KKT conditions.

* Define $A$ be the active set, i.e. $A = {j : \beta^+_j > 0||\beta^-_j > 0}$.

* $\beta(\lambda_0)$ and $\beta(\lambda_1)$ are two points on the lasso path for the same A, and $\lambda_1 - \lambda_0 = \delta$, where $\delta$ is a small number.

We are going to show $\beta(\lambda_1) - \beta(\lambda_0)$ lies on the direction $(X^T_AX_A)^{-1}X^T_Ar$, where $r = y - X_A\beta(\lambda_0)$. (According to the KKT
conditions, $X^T_Ar = \lambda_0 1$.)


## The characteristic of the Lasso path

Define $\beta_A(\lambda)$ to be the corresponding coefficients at $\lambda$, where $\lambda \in [\lambda_0, \lambda_1]$. Deduction 5 of KKT conditions

\begin{align}
&\implies X^T_A(y - X_A\beta_A(\lambda)) = \lambda 1\\
&\implies X^T_AX_A(\beta_A(\lambda_1) - \beta_A(\lambda_0)) = \delta 1\\
&\iff \beta_A(\lambda_1) - \beta_A(\lambda_0) = \delta(X^T_AX_A)^{-1}1
\end{align}

Since $r = y - X_A\beta_A(\lambda_0)$ and $X^T_Ar = \lambda_0 1$

\begin{align}
\beta_A(\lambda_1) - \beta_A(\lambda_0) = \dfrac{\delta}{\lambda_0}(X^T_AX_A)^{-1}X^T_Ar
\end{align}


## The characteristic of the Lasso path

Theorem

*Let $\beta^0 \in R^{2p}$ be a point on the Lasso path in the expanded-variable space ($X = [x,-x]$), and let A be the active set of variables achieving the maximal correlation with the current residual $r = y - X\beta^0$. The Lasso coefficients move in a direction given by the coefficients of the least squares fit of $X_A$ on $r$. Only the coefficients in $A$ change, and this fixed direction is pursued until the first of the following events occurs:*


* *a variable not in A attains the maximal correlation and joins A;*
* *The coefficient of a variable in the active set reaches 0, at which point it leaves A;*
* *the residuals match those of the unrestricted least square fit. when 1 or 2 occur, the direction is recomputed.*

## Connection between Lasso and LAR

Lasso can be thought of as restricted versions of LAR.

1. KKT 5: If $\beta^+_j > 0$, then $x^T_jr = \lambda$ or if $b^-_j > 0$, then $-x^T_jr = \lambda$. (Lasso has this constrain while LAR does not.)

2. LARS-uses least squares directions in the active set of variables;

3. Lasso)uses least square directions; if a variable crosses zero, it is removed from the active set.

## Boosting for linear regression (I) (Friedman, 2000)

Algorithm

1. Start with $r = y - mean(y)$, $\beta_1, \beta_2, ...\beta_p = 0$;

2. Find the predictor $x_j$ most correlated with r (i.e. $j = arg max_{i \in \{1,... ,p\}}|x^T_ir|$);

3. Update $\beta_j \gets \beta_j + \delta_j$ , where $\delta_j = \epsilon · sign(corr(r, x_j))$;

4. Set $r \gets r - \delta_jx_j$ and repeat steps 2 and 3 until no predictor has any correlation with r.



## Boosting for linear regression (II)

To get rid of sign, we can rewrite the algorithm in the expanded space $X = [x,-x]$.

Algorithm

1. Start with $r = y - mean(y)$, $\beta_1, \beta_2, ...\beta_{2p} = 0$;

2. Find the predictor $x_j$ most correlated with r (i.e. $j = arg max_{i \in \{1,... ,2p\}} X^T_ir$);

3. Update $\beta_j \gets \beta_j + \epsilon_j$;

4. Set $r \gets r - \epsilon X_j$ and repeat steps 2 and 3 until no predictor has any correlation with r.


## What is Boosting doing?

\begin{figure}
 \includegraphics[width=300pt, height = 125pt]{pic6.png}
 \caption{Figure: An illustration of Boosting based on LAR}
\end{figure}

* At each step, it selects the variable having largest correlation with the residuals, and moves its coefficient by $\epsilon$.

* There may be a set A of variables competing for this maximal correlation.


## What are the natural constrains of Boosting?

Suppose there are successive N updates. For each j, it takes $N_j$ updates (i.e. $\sum_j N_j = N$). Define $\rho_j = N_j/N$ and thus $\sum_{j\in A} \rho_j = 1$.

1. The change of the coefficient of the variable $X_j$ in A is $\epsilon N_j = \epsilon N \rho_j$, which must be positive $\forall j \in A$.
2. Decrease the residual sum-of-squares as fast as possible.


Consider the optimization problem

\begin{align}
min_{\rho} \dfrac{1}{2}||r - \varepsilon X_A \rho_A||^2  s.t. \rho_j \geq 0; \sum_{j \in A} \rho_j = 1
\end{align}

where $\varepsilon = N\epsilon$.


## KKT condition for Boosting

The Lagrangian is

\begin{align}
L(\rho, \gamma, \lambda) = \dfrac{1}{2}||r - \varepsilon X_A \rho_A||^2 - \sum_j \gamma_j \rho_j + \lambda(\sum_j \rho_j - 1)
\end{align}

with KKT conditions

\begin{align}
-\varepsilon X^T_A(r - \varepsilon X_A \rho_A) - \gamma + \lambda 1 &= 0\\
\lambda_j &\geq 0\\
\rho_j &\geq 0\\
\lambda_j \rho_j &= 0\\
\sum_j \rho_j &= 1
\end{align}

\small{Note that $\rho_j \geq 0 \implies \gamma_j = 0$. This shows that the correlations with the residual remain equal. This also implies the relationship between LAR and Boosting.}



## Boosting and non-negative least square

\begin{align}
min_{\rho} \dfrac{1}{2}||r -  X_A \theta_A||^2 s.t.\theta_j \geq 0
\end{align}

Let $\theta^*$ be the solution. Then $\rho^* = \dfrac{\theta^*}{||\theta^*||_1}$ solve the optimization problem of Boosting:

\begin{align}
min_{\rho} \dfrac{1}{2}||r -  X_A \theta_A||^2 s.t.\sum_{j \in A} \rho_j = 1
\end{align}
This can be done by checking the KKT conditions.

Boosting uses non-negative least squares directions in the active set.


## Boosting path

Theorem

*Let $\beta^0 \in R^{2p}$ be a point on the Lasso path in the expanded-variable space ($X = [x,-x]$), and let A be the active set of variables achieving the maximal correlation with the current residual $r = y - X\beta^0$. The Boosting coefficients move in a direction given by the coefficients of the non-negative least squares fit of $X_A$ on r. Only the coefficients in A change, and this fixed direction is pursued until the first of the following events occurs:*

* *a variable not in A attains the maximal correlation and joins A;*
* *The coefficient of a variable in the active set reaches 0, at which point it leaves A; This is only for Lasso. For Boosting, the coefficients should be nondecreasing.*
* *the residuals match those of the unrestricted least square fit. when 1 occurs, the direction is recomputed.*


## summary: LAR, Lasso and Boosting

\textcolor{blue}{LAR} uses least squares directions in the active set of variables.

\textcolor{blue}{Lasso} uses least square directions; if a variable crosses zero, it is removed from the active set.

\textcolor{blue}{Boosting} uses non-negative least squares directions in the active set.

From another perspective,

\textcolor{blue}{Boosting} successive differences of $\beta_j$ agree in sign with the current correlation $c_j = x^T_j r$. ( Step 3: $\beta_j \gets \beta_j + \delta_j$ , where $\delta_j = \epsilon · sign(corr(r, x_j)))$

\textcolor{blue}{Lasso} $\beta_j$ agrees in sign with $c_j$. (KKT condition 5)

\textcolor{blue}{LAR} no sign restrictions.


## What are their performances ?

## Comments

* The speed of Overfitting: LAR > Lasso > Boosting
* The smoothness of the Path: Boosting > Lasso and LAR
* The minimum CV error: They are almost the same.

Boosting is preferable to Lasso and LAR in the problems with large numbers of correlated predictors because of its stability.


More examples which support this comment can be found in the paper:

*T. Hastie, Forward stagewise regression and the monotone lasso. Electronic Journal of Statistics, 2007.*


## Boosting with CART

Instead of linear predictors, CART can be used in Boosting.

1. Start with function $F(x) = 0$ and residual $r = y$
2. Fit a CART regression tree to r giving $f (x)$
3. Set $F(x) \gets F(x) + \epsilon f (x),  r \gets r - \epsilon f (x)$ and repeat step 2 many times


## Loss function


* Boosting is easily extended to some other convex loss functions $L(y, F(x))$, e.g., Logistical loss function. The residual r will be taken place by the negative gradient of the loss function. This is so-called “gradient boosting”.
    
    - Least square loss:
     $L = \dfrac{1}{2}\sum_i (y_i - f (x_i))^2 \to - \dfrac{\partial L}{\partial f (x_i)} = y_i - f (x_i)$
    - Logistical loss:
     $L = \dfrac{1}{2}\sum_i (y_i f (x_i)-log(1+f (x_i)))^2 \to - \dfrac{\partial L}{\partial f (x_i)} = y_i - \dfrac{1}{1+exp(f (x_i))}$
    - Exponential loss, Poisson loss, ...

* Lasso can be extended to some other convex loss functions
as well, and solved by convex optimization.


## Incorporate disease models into Boosting

\begin{figure}
 \includegraphics[width=300pt, height = 100pt]{pic13.png}
 \caption{Figure: epistasis models}
\end{figure}

Take the place of CART by epistasis models.

1. Start with function $F(x) = 0$ and residual $r = y$
2. Fit a disease model to r giving $f (x)$
3. Set $F(x) \gets F(x) + \epsilon f (x),  r \gets r - \epsilon f (x)$ and repeat step 2 many times



## The advantages of incorporate disease models into boosting for the SNP problem

1. We will not worry about the marginal effects (i.e., main effects) as in MegaSNPHunter. Of course we pay more computation efforts to choose a disease model.
2. We can answer the question formally: Whether these disease models are realistic?
3. We can handle heterogeneity in the data naturally since we employ additive model in Boosting process. (Additive models can approximate heterogeneity model well.)
4. It’s computationally feasible for one chromosome (about 10,000 SNPs). There is no need for worrying about the memory.
5. It overfits very slowly because of the nature of Boosting.
